## ‚ö†Ô∏è Business Problems and Solutions

This project focuses on solving six critical inventory and sales-related challenges faced by businesses:

---

### 1. üîç Inaccurate Demand Forecasting  
**Problem:**  
Businesses often rely on outdated or simplistic forecasting models, resulting in overstocking or understocking. This leads to increased holding costs or missed sales opportunities.

**Solution:**  
The dashboard integrates historical sales data, seasonal patterns, and key metrics to support data-driven forecasting. Visual trend lines and filterable time series help managers refine reorder strategies and align stock levels with projected demand.

---

### 2. üì¶ Lack of Real-Time Inventory Visibility  
**Problem:**  
Without real-time tracking, inventory inconsistencies cause overselling, stockouts, and shipment delays.

**Solution:**  
This Tableau dashboard simulates real-time tracking with up-to-date views of stock levels across all locations. Visual alerts and stock-level heatmaps make it easy to identify low-stock items and take proactive actions.

---

### 3. ‚öôÔ∏è Inefficient Warehouse Operations  
**Problem:**  
Manual errors and non-digitized workflows slow down warehouse efficiency and accuracy.

**Solution:**  
The dashboard identifies stock discrepancies, highlights slow-moving items, and evaluates picking and packing performance. It encourages process automation and supports strategic layout planning to optimize warehouse operations.

---

### 4. üåê Managing Multi-Channel Inventory  
**Problem:**  
Selling on multiple platforms leads to fragmented inventory data and poor synchronization across channels.

**Solution:**  
The dashboard consolidates inventory data from various channels into a centralized view. It supports better fulfillment decisions and reduces the risk of overselling or underselling across platforms.

---

### 5. üè∑Ô∏è Dealing with SKU Proliferation  
**Problem:**  
Expanding product lines increases complexity, making it hard to manage stock and analyze performance across numerous SKUs.

**Solution:**  
The dashboard categorizes SKUs and visualizes their performance, helping businesses focus on high-performing or underperforming products. It supports lifecycle management and assists in rationalizing the product portfolio.

---

### 6. üöö Managing Supplier Reliability and Lead Times  
**Problem:**  
Unreliable suppliers and unpredictable lead times lead to stockouts and missed revenue.

**Solution:**  
Using Tableau‚Äôs analytics, the dashboard tracks supplier lead times and identifies delays. This visibility helps build contingency plans and fosters better supplier performance management.

## üßæ Key Inventory Columns Explained

Below are explanations of some critical columns used in the dataset:

- **Reorder Point:**  
  The stock level at which a new order should be placed to replenish inventory before it runs out. Helps prevent stockouts.

- **Lead Time Days:**  
  The number of days between placing an order with a supplier and receiving the stock. Affects when to trigger reorders.

- **Last Restock Date:**
